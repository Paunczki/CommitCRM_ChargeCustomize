First thing is first, 
Do not attempt to do much to change the database {%%} parts in the HTML code

CommitCRM is not very helpful with changing anything database built
But they are very kind about helping with know what simple are

If you want to find specifics as to what is pulled (what the {%%} calls)
You have to visit the fullCCRMHTML.html file and attempt to find it based on what divs are where

Archived - The archived section is meant for files I was working on earlier,
           and parts that did not become relative

Files for Page Host - This is the JS and other files that I could pull 
                      and then are present in case someone wants to change/add

backup.html - Is the original html file from CommitCRM that we use

CCRMCharge.html - the entire page elements of backup (slpedit22501.html)

devGuide.txt - Explanation on files for anyone want to build on this project

djangoCompare.txt - meant to describe what difference occurs once that section is removed
                    Current code calls {%%} functions that create the webpage

fullCCRMHTML.html - full copy/paste of the CommitCRM Labor Charge page (of my changes)
                    A way to see what a {%%} call produces

paulUpgrade.html - The edit Paul wanted me to work on to replace the slpedit22501.html file

paulUpgradeJS.js - This is the main javascript that I added to the head of paulUpgrade.html

README.md - Quick overview for anyone visiting the github page

versionOne.html - The regular edit they wanted me to work on to replace the slpedit22501.html file

versionOneJS.js - This is the main javascript that I added to the head of versionOne.html
