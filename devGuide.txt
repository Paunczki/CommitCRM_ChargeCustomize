INTRODUCTION

First thing is first, 
Do not attempt to do much to change the database {%%} parts in the HTML code

CommitCRM is not very helpful with changing anything database built
But they are very kind about helping with know what simple are

If you want to find specifics as to what is pulled (what the {%%} calls)
You have to visit the fullCCRMHTML.html file and attempt to find it based on what divs are where

Archived - The archived section is meant for files I was working on earlier,
           and parts that did not become relative

Files for Page Host - This is the JS and other files that I could pull 
                      and then are present in case someone wants to change/add

backup.html - Is the original html file from CommitCRM that we use

CCRMCharge.html - the entire page elements of backup (slpedit22501.html)

devGuide.txt - Explanation on files for anyone want to build on this project

djangoCompare.txt - meant to describe what difference occurs once that section is removed
                    Current code calls {%%} functions that create the webpage

fullCCRMHTML.html - full copy/paste of the CommitCRM Labor Charge page (of my changes)
                    A way to see what a {%%} call produces

README.md - Quick overview for anyone visiting the github page

versionOne.html - The regular edit they wanted me to work on to replace the slpedit22501.html file

versionOneJS.js - This is the main javascript that I added to the head of versionOne.html

versionTwo.html - The edit Paul wanted me to work on to replace the slpedit22501.html file

versionTwoJS.js - This is the main javascript that I added to the head of paulUpgrade.html

BASIC START

If you are trying to do any changes, make sure you are working around CommitCRM database
You must work with CommitCRM items since they do not allow you to change anything backend
This is why new sections are instead filled into the description instead of vice-versa

You need to use djangoCompare.txt to understand what needs to be done
It explains each call and how you can use it
Note: Sometimes certain calls must be made before others in order pulls to be correct
      (if there are certain issues reach out to CommitCRM Support --> support@commitcrm.com)
      (I reached out when certain parts were not working correct and they will reorganize)

When attempting to make changes, follow these steps
  1. Make the changes in your HTML file
  2. Copy the entire file
  3. Remote into the Virtual Machine hosting a copy of CommitCRM
  4. Open the HTML file hosting the page (in this case slpedit22501.html)
  5. Remove all the code and paste in your own
  6. Save the page
  7. Refresh the CommitCRM page
  8. Observe your changes
If the change is larger and is not appearing, try this
  - Through Windows Services, restart Advantage Website Server and/or CommitWebInterface
    - Note: You must restart the Advantage Website server first 
            this is due to the Web Interface pulling information from it

ISSUES

Here are some of the issues that could be fixed 
I experienced these issues, which will take a while to fix, 
but not necessary based on how CommitCRM has built there software

Most of these issues are not huge since there are errors from CommitCRM vanilla that mirror these
That is why I did not tackle some of them

1. If you remove the ending part (i.e. /1z11qjg1vkgk8q1czndh80knm0dc/$)
   to start from the beginning, the information you had stored before appears
   This is due to the values still being stored to the session since the session wasn't ended
   Possible Solution: Might just need a remove session storage on the starting ticket page
2. Not an issue but design problem
   On refreshes everything kind-of bulk loads, should try to smoothen transitions
3. Tab indexing, when pressing tab by going from end time to break length does not work properly
   Currently there is nothing you can do with this for web browsers
   The way going from box to box with pressing tab key is it jumps to the next div/box
   They are next to each other based on HTML code, but within backend/database probably not


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


USING THIS DESIGN

To use these designs
    version 1 --> versionOne.html
    version 2 --> versionTwo.html
CommitCRM wants you to make a new file and name it slpedit22501customng1.html
and then paste the code from that version into your new file.
This should result in your changes appearing

I attempted this but it did not seem to work.

This is the proper way and should be attempted,
but in case it does not work just paste it into slpedit22501.html


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


STARTING ANEW

In case you want to start all over from the design given from CommitCRM
paste the code from backup.html

backup.html is the original file of the original charge page
