So far best bet is to go to 
  E://CommitCRM/Server/
And look through those files for database information
NOT FOUND HERE

Have to be aware that CommitCRM focuses a lot on the desktop version
Because of this finding the information may still be in 
  E://CommitCRM/WebInterface
NOTHING FOUND HERE

Now checking
  E://CommitCRM/DbSys or E://CommitCRM/Db
Hoping here is more successful
