So far best bet is to go to 
  E://CommitCRM/Server/
And look through those files for database information
NOT FOUND HERE

Have to be aware that CommitCRM focuses a lot on the desktop version
Because of this finding the information may still be in 
  E://CommitCRM/WebInterface
NOTHING FOUND HERE

Now checking
  E://CommitCRM/DbSys or E://CommitCRM/Db
Hoping here is more successful

E://CommitCRM/Db
seems to be the move and the correct folder
Once I turned off the Advantage Datavase Server
I was able to access the files within
The issue now is trying to decode these files, 
and then add my parts

The ADI ADM and ADT files all have some of them that are in use when db up


Looking into C://Program Files/Advantage 11.10/ Server
From here using the application parts given and trying to figure something out

There seems to be no way I can access the files within the advantage database Server
Will continue looking, but real pain


Also isolated that the Advantage Database Server is the only .\admin process needed
The CommitWebInterface is the running part but somehow it calls Advantage Database Server

For executable to Advantage Database Server --> C:\Program Files\Advantage 11.10\Server\ADS.EXE
Does have dependencies but nothing too useful


Will continue looking into C://Program Files/Advantage 11.10/ Server
C://Program Files/Advantage 11.10/Server  Help page within is useless

Will create new page for that to list what each thing does/looks like
