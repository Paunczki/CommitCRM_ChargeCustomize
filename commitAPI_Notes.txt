Have looked into the API a lot
but to show I have read through it all
I will take notes to make sure I truly understand every possible aspect
http://www.commitcrm.com/wiki/Commit_API_Developers_Guide 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Web API
 - "The Web API allows you to interact with your CommitCRM server and 
    data over the Web using HTTP"

CommitCRM API 
    - "CommitCRM provides an API which allows you to add and update records in the 
       CommitCRM database. The API includes a list of possible actions and parameters."
    - 

ODBC Link (Open Data Base Connectivity)
    - "ODBC is a function library which provides a common API for ODBC compliant databses.
       CommitCRM provides an open database and allows other applications to access the 
       databse using ODBC for read-only purposes."
    - 

Record
    - "Each entity in the CommitCRM database (such as Ticket, Account, Asset, Item, 
       Appointment, Task, etc.) is considered a 'record.'"
    - 

Database fields
    - "Each record contains a list of fields, each of which holds the record's data."
    - 

Transaction
    - "All additions or updates to record in the database are done by using a transaction.
      Each transaction includes the operation you wish to perform, the data type you wish
      to add/update and the additional parameters (databse fields and their values)."
    - 

Transaction Parameters
    - "Each transaction contains the parameters for performing the transaction: 
      record type, list of databse fields and a list of the values to be updated in 
      these fields."
    - 

External Application
    - "This refers to the external program which integrates with CommitCRM in order to 
      update the database. This name should be passed when performing updates to the 
      database, and it will be saved in the CommitCRM record to indiicated who performed 
      the changes."
    - 

Record ID (REC ID)
    - "Each record in the CommitCRMhas a unique Record ID which is created when adding the 
      record to the database. Every ID is 20 characters and should be transferred with the 
      API transaction when you need to update an existing record."
