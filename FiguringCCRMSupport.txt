    <div class="col-sm-6 CmtDisplayNone">  
        <div class="form-group  ">
            <label class="col-sm-2 control-label CmtEdit ">{%cmtlbldescfldslpuser1%}</label>
            <div class="col-sm-8">
                {%cmtedtdatafldslpuser1_cmttabindex16%}
            </div>               
        </div>
    </div>

All this should do is make the part present but not shown hopefully

**********************************************************************

The {%%} calls made and what they mean
  - cmtedtdataFLDSLPTIMESPENTINMIN_cmttabindex8
      - Takes in a numerical time input for Time Spent
  - cmtlbldescfldslpuser1
      - Calls Field1 label
  - cmtedtdatafldslpuser1_cmttabindex16
      - Gets all parts of Field for select value

So looking over this, it seems like the last two calls are useless
Since of course the Field part does not show up
It may be necessary to have everything else work 

There is no clear way as to why the Save began to work except maybe the field part
