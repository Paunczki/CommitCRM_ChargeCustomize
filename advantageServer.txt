# What this is

Since CommitCRM is very secure about going around their programs,
  we need to do science to actually understand this
For this reason we will go through every file within
    C://Program Files/Advantage 11.10/Server
  just to see if we can get someonewhere closer
Have looked at the Db files from the E://CommitCRM,
  but it is in an unknown charset
I have looked through these files already, 
  but never have been successful
This is meant as a double check 
  and maybe push this information to someone else to take a look at
