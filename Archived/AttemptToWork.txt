CardID and ContactID same
Looking further this is the CardID for SBTC

Multiple uses of BCRECID, therefore I do not believe it to be unique to me

Put this into splips.adt, but the charge comes up empty... 
Wondering if the RECID calls somewhere else to get information
The slipdate, workerid, and recID all come up
Delayed push, but the entire charge came up
So we know this is the data table called to have shown

Will continue looking for more information in the database
