The div we want the iFrame to only show this div
    <div id="cmtslpEdtbleGuiSct" class="row CmtGenEdtForm CmtGenEdtFormLft CmtLineSpc">
But most likely will still need to figure out some save part (if need div of save)
    <input type="button" name="btnslpeditsave1" id="btnslpeditsave1" value="Save" onclick="CmtslpMakeSaveByCtrl(this)" class="btn btn-primary clsbtngenedit">
Django call to save button
    btnslpeditsave1

Use this format to call a certain part
    $('#target-div').load('http://www.mywebsite.com/portfolio.php #portfolio-sports');

Problem is now to find out what is the page to this site

Does not seem like it will work since we really cant have a unique account that will send to database.
Thinking that to see if we can just have the contents saved to a file and then have on click of save 
it begins to open/referesh the window untill all charges are cleared

iFrame is not going to be 


Used --> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/251420/invoking-javascript-code-in-an-iframe-from-the-parent-page
need to Use
  - document.getElementById('targetFrame').contentWindow.targetFunction();
And the target function will be
  - CmtCallToSrvEx('lnkgenslplist','cmthidegenslplist','btnXClickslplistinsertslpf_slp');

This is a last attempt before archiving this
