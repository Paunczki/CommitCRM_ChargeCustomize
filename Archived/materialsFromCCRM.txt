This file is me taking notes on the links I received to search through from CommitCRM
They do not seem useful but I will give it a try

Customizing Existing Fields
  - Fields in CommitCRM can be customized with the following settings
      - The Name of the fields as displayed throughout the system where a field name 
        is displayed
      - The field Label and Hint
      - The field title on data grids/tables â€“ Column Title
      - The default value for new records
      - The drop-down list that will be displayed for drop-down selection list fields
      - Enabling the field to be updated in batch update (Accounts fields only)
      - Enabling lists to be sorted by this field
  - To modify the field settings, log in to CommitCRM as a user with full privileges, 
    and double-click on the field label

Adding new tabs
  - Useless because I do not want to add new tabs right now
  - I really want to find the code for the files
    so that I do not have to rewrite everything myself

Creating New Fields
  - To add new fields to user-defined tabs you can use two options:
      - Right-click the tab area and choose Add New Field to Tab.
      - Go to Tools > Field Management and from the Field Management Window, click the 
        New icon to add a new field.
  - You can either add existing fields to be displayed in your tab, or create totally 
    new fields in the database that will be displayed in your tab. 
  - This seems helpful if I was using Desktop interface, but we will not. I need the 
    functions

Viewing link - http://www.commitcrm.com/wiki/API_Reference_Manual#Charge_Fields

The only thing that would be of interest to me is the charge fields 
since this is what I only need to save to

I have already found this table and understood how its works through searching
What I really need is the {%...%} function files
