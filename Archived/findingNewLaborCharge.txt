Very apparent that there is a format being used that creates the complete HTML page
In order to narrow down which page it is, I need to look through all these
Take notes on specific files being called as well as formats
From there I will have to look at the most likely files until we know for sure it is the charges page

Also to be aware of is the naming convention
Many times the names are abbreviated in an easy way to understand
As I understand the naming convention, I will update it in NotesOnFormat.txt

Big Success! The comments at the bottom are calling lines for the identifying 3 letter abbreviations,
Since Big comment is <!-- slp SLP --> that means we can lower it down to 7 HTML file templates

slpview22501.html does not have the <!-- slp SLP --> comment, removing

Attempting to open all extensions and look for additional comments

slpedit22501
  - Contains <!--CmtSysInfo1--> and <!--CmtSysInfo2-->
  - Contians comments that are not present in actual charges
slpedit22531
  - Contains <!--CmtSysInfo1--> and <!--CmtSysInfo2-->
  - Contians comments that are not present in actual charges
slpfull22501
  - Contains <!--CmtSysInfo1--> and <!--CmtSysInfo2-->
  - Contians comments that are not present in actual charges
slplist22501
  - Contains <!--CmtSysInfo1--> and <!--CmtSysInfo2-->
slplist22509
  - Contains <!--CmtSysInfo1--> and <!--CmtSysInfo2-->
slpview22509
  - Contains <!--CmtSysInfo1--> and <!--CmtSysInfo2-->
  - Contians comments that are not present in actual charges

After this quick check through comments, I will narrow it down to 
slplist22509.html and slplist22501.html

Only difference I clearly see when switching between the two is right before the body ends
22501 has {%CmtEmpMdlFrmCode%} whereas 22509 does not
Here are my additional notes seperating these

CmtEmpMdlFrmCode is not found in the CommitCRM folder which leads me to believe it os slplist22509.html

slplist22509.html is the main screen

improved method by writing within the files and found that adding charges can be found on
slpedit22501.html
