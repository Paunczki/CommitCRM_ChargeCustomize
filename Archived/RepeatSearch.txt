I have looked through these files before and did a quick search,
but I now have a better idea of what is needed 

I will be searching for any leads on where the CSS and JavaScript
files are being called from

Initial guess is that they will still be in Db, 
but will need to keep looking

Look into files within CommitCRM by searching is-7M252.tmp
  --> Nothing found

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Client
  - Seems to only be needed on the desktop version
  - Does not seem to be helpful

Db
  - See tables.txt

DbSys
  - All User + WORKERID just have the letter W in them 
  - cmtdmdt has some demo SQL commands,
    refer to this if you want to see some examples

Docs
  - The files witihn documents are not necessary for functions

DocsExport
  - Quotes for exporting

Filters
  - Empty

Help
  - For help page
  - Does not seem to be helpful

Import
  - Just files for uploading

LastVer
  - Seems like a backup
  - See this to follow these files to where they are originally

Logs
  - Lots of logs about updates and such 

RMM
  - Assuming this is remote monitoring and management
  - Does not seem to be helpful

SBTCCRM
  - Just has some files, but useless

Server
  - ServerConfig only has to do with emails and locations
  - And according to the README this CommtServer 
    is only for use of 2 modules
      - Commit Alerts Server
      - Commit Email Connector 
  - This is not being used with our sever so not worrying

ShellG
  - Empty

Templates
  - Empty (this is for desktop version), want WebInterface

test
  - Empty 

ThirdParty
  - UserDev and QuickBooks present as 3rd party software
  - Cannot see how either helps or is used within charges

TmpCommit
  - Can't really use this because I do not know what is what

Utils
  - This is all for Upgrading, installing, etc.
  - Could be helpful but nothing super serious

WebInterface
  - The most important 
  - Lots of .dll that might be necessary
  - Found calls to C://admin/Appdata/Local/Temp
      - Seems like a dead-end, might look into Microsoft IIS

XternalDataFiles1
  - Does not seem to be helpful

XternalDataFiles2
  - Does not seem to be helpful

XternalDataFiles3
  - Does not seem to be helpful

XternalDataFiles4
  - Does not seem to be helpful

Logs (zipp)
  - Seems like repeat of logs

LogsUserLog_
  - Cannot understand where this would be useful from
  - Looks like it contains information about quotes 
    but unecessary right now

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Not much success found 
Nothing up front of what is happening, 
so now I amgoing to look deeper
