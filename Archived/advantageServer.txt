# What this is

Since CommitCRM is very secure about going around their programs,
  we need to do science to actually understand this
For this reason we will go through every file within
    C://Program Files/Advantage 11.10/Server
  just to see if we can get someonewhere closer
Have looked at the Db files from the E://CommitCRM,
  but it is in an unknown charset
I have looked through these files already, 
  but never have been successful
This is meant as a double check 
  and maybe push this information to someone else to take a look at

# files

ace64.dll (Apllication extension)
    - opened in Notepad
    - crazy ling and unknown charset

ads (Application)
    - Opened normally and got this message
        - The Advantage Database Server is a Windows NT/2000 Service.  
          It can only be started from the Windows NT/2000 Service Control Manager.
    - Probably since already set up in services no need to worry

ads_cfg (Application)
    - Opened normally and this time got results!
    - Claims this is the installation path
        - C:\Program Files\Advantage 11.10\Server\ADS.EXE
        - Port : 6262
            - But Webinterface on is 4961
            - Seems legit since says current users one, which is me
    - Says Sybase iAnywhere, so might need look for that type of software
    - Look into ANSI Character Set and OEM Character Set

ads_cfg (Configuration settings)
    - Opens in notepad and the only thing visible is
        - [Settings]
        - ServiceName=Advantage
    - This is most likely nothing, not worrying about

adsbackup.c (C File)
    - Opened in notepad since C File
    - very large file so I will give quick info about
    - Notes: This utility loads ACE32.DLL or libace.so dynamically so it can
            be used with different versions of ACE.  The minimum ACE version
            requirement is v6.0.  However, if the server OS is NetWare, the
            ACE version must be 7.0 or greater.
        - These files are not present so this may be useless, not sure yet
    -  While looking through everything, I am led to believe this does not 
       look like anything important for my line of work
    - From name, assuming it is how the server is backedup

adsbackup (Application)
    - Open normally, terminal quickly flashes and goes away, nothing else
    - Ran as administrator and same thing occured
    - Nothing conclusive, but as a guess I would say it quickly backs up 
      the server from that instance in time

adscollate (ADM File)
    - Open with notepad and very weird charset
    - Open with internet explorer
        - forces me to download

    - Open normally and gives me 3 options (With descriptions)
        - Upgrade, Languages, license
    - Nothing seems important here for what I need

ADSSupportCapture (Application)
    - Opened normally and takes me to terminal

      out to ADS , gives y/n options
    - I am not continuing

adsver (Application)
    - I open normally, a transparent window opens quickly and closes
    - Guess this is to run the server 
    - Not sure since when I open ads_cfg, up time is not recent
