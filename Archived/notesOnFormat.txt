{%[***myofficesetting1***]%}
This format gets the file "myofficesetting1" 
no matter where its directory is or not matter what type of file it is

So when you see {%[...]%}
Know it is calling another file to use it

Other specifics are based on bootstrap (to understand spacing)
Basically all you need to know is col-sm-2 is column small-2

Another good source of finding what HTML file we are dealing with could be comments
so look for comments that look similar

  - and on the adding a charge you are technically 'editing' a charge

{% %}
  - Django programming language
  - Whatever text is inbetween this is a call to a special function or code running, 
    and the result of that will be here
