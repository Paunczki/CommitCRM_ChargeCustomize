# CommitCRM_ChargeCustomize


## For Later Developers

See the file **devGuide.txt** to get a development guide


## Background

CommitCRM does not really focus on the Web Interface, as stated by them...
"Please note that the installed client is more feature rich."

The company wants the online version for tracking time which coworkers want to use the 
Web Interface instead of starting up the program just to use it for 2 minutes.
Currently their charges page works, but for the multiple tasks and services at the company 
we want a more efficient way of uploading all the tasks we do
