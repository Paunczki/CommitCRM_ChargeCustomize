What can be done in jQuery
I was asked to do certain tasks with jQuery on the new page, 
and I am going to take notes and links here

Asked for 
  - Make the three boxes and see if you can pull in the save features that are currently missing
      - Three boxes is easy to do
      - To check to see what is missing need to find what JS code does this first
      - Will then need to worry about saving
          - To save will need to search for null fields
          - Will have to decide what qualifications are needed in order to qualify as saveable
          - Two options to solve
              - If fulfills certain requirements, alert/color light that this ticket will be saved
                  - Color light - a little color light can appear at the top right at the box
                      - If light green will be saved as seperate charge
                          - If you scroll over the light it will tell you "Ready to be saved"
                      - If red, will not be saved because basic requirements not met
                          - If you scroll over, will list vertically requirements still needed
                  - Alert, telling which boxes are going to be saved
              - Create a check box at the top that stages the charge to upload
                  - If does not meet requirements, alert which staged charge is not applicable to submission
                      - This will have to have some type of naming convention for each charge
                  - Else, save each as seperate ticket
  - According to Paul, want to create two buttons to differentiate Techs and Help Desk
      - Creating the buttons is easy, just styling needs to find the CSS
      - if want huge CSS changing, then might need to find the original file
      - Want once the button is clicked, to expand the box and make new fields
  - Work on finding jQuery code that allows for onclick to EXPAND AND SHOW NEW FIELDS
      - https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_hide_show.asp
      - https://api.jquery.com/toggle/
      - https://api.jquery.com/show/
          - This tutorial just hides/shows a division
          - If I make a master division for techs and supports, technically everything will be present at once
          - Some parts will be hidden and expanded once clicked (when clicked I want the tech/support box to change color)
          - This should work just fine since it is a simple hide/show, so fields can always be filled
      - I can have the fields show/not show, so from here I think it would be nice to have the color light idea
      - So that we can have smaller boxes that can grow/shrink and it does not look bad
      - Will still have to discuss with Paul how he wants account to work

Other issues still present
  - Currently when I press save, it does not do anything
  - Also account does not lock in the account once clicked
      - To fix this I will look to see what {%...%} is missing and does not seem to add another feature
  - If want more information added, I will need to add columns in the database
      - Then need to find out what code will access this/it


Update on situation
  - Spoke to Paul about design
  - Version one is what I have been working on for Scott and just need to wait on CommitCRM to reply to make sure items can be staged properly (as separate charges)
  - Today I will create the three separate charge, leaving the add another entry part for later
